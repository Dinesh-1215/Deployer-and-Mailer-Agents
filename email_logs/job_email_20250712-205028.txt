Dear [Hiring Manager Name],

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the TensorFlow/Agent-focused AI Developer position advertised on [Platform where you saw the job posting].  Having followed [Company Name]'s innovative work in [mention specific area if known], I am confident my skills and experience align perfectly with your requirements.

As an AI Developer with two years of experience at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), I have a proven track record of building end-to-end intelligent solutions leveraging large language models, AI agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). My expertise spans the entire development lifecycle, from model fine-tuning with domain-specific data and designing embedding-based search systems to automating tasks through sophisticated agent workflows.

My experience at TCS directly addresses many of the key requirements outlined in the job description.  Specifically, I:

* **Developed and deployed production-ready applications using TensorFlow:**  My work on automotive test case generation significantly reduced generation time (30%) and improved accuracy (25%) through the integration of RAG and automated simulation and validation.  I also utilized Flora and PEFT for model optimization.
* **Built and integrated AI agents into complex workflows:**  My Agentic RAG system for internal QA reduced manual support queries by 40%, demonstrating my proficiency in building and deploying agent-based solutions using LangChain.  Furthermore, I have experience with Agno and Crewai.
* **Leveraged LLMs for various applications:** I have extensive experience evaluating and utilizing open-source LLMs (LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, Mistral), showcasing my ability to adapt to different model architectures and optimize performance.  My projects, including the Resume Matcher and MERN Stack AI CRUD app, further highlight this versatility.

My resume provides further detail on my accomplishments, including my experience with Python, NLP, various vector databases, Flask, and my certifications in Azure AI and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI.

I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how my skills can contribute to [Company Name]'s success. Thank you for your time and consideration.
