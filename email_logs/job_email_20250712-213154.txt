Dear Goldman Sachs Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Senior Application Developer position within your Generative AI & Document AI Platform team, as advertised on [Platform where you saw the advert - e.g., Goldman Sachs careers website].  Having followed Goldman Sachs' innovative work in AI for some time, I am particularly excited by the opportunity to contribute to such a cutting-edge initiative.

My resume, attached for your review, details my two years of experience as an AI/ML Developer at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), where I successfully built and deployed several end-to-end intelligent solutions leveraging large language models, AI agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  My projects demonstrate a strong proficiency in Python, NLP, and generative AI, with a consistent focus on creating scalable, efficient, and impactful real-world applications.

Specifically, my experience aligns well with the requirements outlined in the job description.  I have extensive experience with:

* Building scalable distributed platforms:  My work on the Automotive Test Case Generation tool involved building a Flask-based UI and integrating with TensorFlow for automated simulation and validation, demonstrating my ability to create scalable solutions.
* Relational and Non-Relational Databases: I am proficient in using SQL and have experience working with various NoSQL databases, including those mentioned in the requirements.
* RESTful Web Services:  The development of my Flask-based UI for the test case generation tool showcases my experience in building and deploying RESTful web services.
* End-to-End Software Product Development: I have consistently designed, developed, and deployed complete software products from concept to deployment, as evidenced by my various projects (Resume Matcher, MERN Stack AI CRUD App, etc.).
* LangChain and RAG: My experience developing an Agentic RAG system for internal QA using LangChain directly addresses a preferred qualification.

While my experience falls slightly short of the minimum years of experience requested, I am confident that my skills and accomplishments, particularly in the specific technologies and methodologies relevant to this role, make me a strong candidate.  My recent certifications in Azure AI and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure AI, further demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of AI advancements.

I am eager to learn more about this exciting opportunity and discuss how my skills and passion for AI can benefit Goldman Sachs. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Dinesh Karri
